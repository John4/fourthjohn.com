# CROWDDJ

<a href="https://github.com/crowddj">https://github.com/crowddj</a>

Ever DJing a party and end up having the aux cord pulled from you by unsatisfied party-goers? Crowd DJ is here to save the party. Allow everyone at the party to give you suggestions, vote on other's suggestions, and rate the music they're currently listening to.

<b>Crowd DJ won Best UI/Design at HackBeanpot 2017.</b> It's built with React, Firebase, and a Chrome Extension. Use it at your next party.
